# express-bower-grunt

This is a nice starting point for using:

- bower to handle frontend dependencies
- grunt to handle processing assets (building sass, building JST templates, concating JS files)
- express for web server

The client-side source files (javascripts, stylesheets, templates) go in ```client/```.

The server-side source files (routes, models, views) go in ```server/```.
